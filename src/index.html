    <h1>Hi, I'm Tristan Lehmbecker!</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>I'm a backend-oriented full-stack software engineer with a knack for building scalable and reliable systems. I have worked on an number of teams and as a independent consultant in a variety of industries including healthcare, e-commerce, and real estate over the last 7+ years.</p>

        <p>
            I've built and maintained systems at all scales, from working with an early-stage startup (seed and Series A), taking them from inception to full launch, to serving established companies and many in between.
        </p>

        <p>
            My core languages are Typescript, PHP, and Python. I am exceptionally comfortable working with relational databases including Postgres & MySQL, but I've also worked with NoSQL databases including MongoDB (including DocumentDB), and DynamoDB.
            When it comes to cloud providers I'm most at experienced working within AWS, but I've also worked with Heroku, Google Cloud, and Firebase.
